1
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,134
These biscuits are good.

2
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,017
Say... Will you tell me what my suit is?

3
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,651
That guy you're paired with...

4
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,238
He's a murderer, you know?

5
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,866
What?

6
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,493
I saw him in the papers.

7
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,620
He's Sunato Banda,

8
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,208
an infamous killer
who took the lives of four women.

9
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,628
I think he was sentenced to death.

10
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,631
That's a lie.

11
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,757
It's the truth.

12
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:35,220
I think he's the Jack of Hearts.

13
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,766
There are five of us left.

14
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,437
I'm sure that the Jack will go
on the offensive now.

15
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,649
Let's tell each other's suits.

16
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,074
You're in a good position now.

17
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,285
The Jack trusts you.

18
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,706
You're the only one
who can lie to the Jack.

19
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,837
In other words,
the only person who can end this game

20
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,005
is you.

21
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,472
It seems you still can't trust me.

22
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:26,062
In any case, to make sure
that Banda is telling you the truth,

23
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,607
I think you and I should
tell each other's suits.

24
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,821
Do you really think I can trust you?

25
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,407
It doesn't matter to me if you can't.

26
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,827
The more choices you have, the better.
Isn't that right?

27
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,080
I swear to you, I'll tell the truth.

28
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,001
It's also true that Banda is a murderer.

29
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,463
I can't trust you.

30
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:58,303
Well, I'm sure we'll see
who's right this round.

31
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,931
Your suit is spade.

32
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,645
Tell me what mine is.

33
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,359
Hey.

34
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,612
I told you yours.

35
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,282
I didn't agree to this deal.

36
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,999
Heart.

37
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,473
What's wrong?

38
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,274
The Jack of Hearts...

39
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,069
is that guy.

40
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,991
I also suspected him.

41
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,161
But don't worry.

42
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,124
He'll die this round.

43
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,721
That Banda guy...

44
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,935
We need to be extremely cautious of him.

45
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,525
The young guy who first lied
to that big guy and killed him...

46
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,363
It was this guy
who told the young guy to lie.

47
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,659
I saw him do it.

48
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,413
He looks kind.

49
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,250
But in reality,
he completely lacks empathy for others.

50
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,421
He only has a theoretical understanding
of other people's feelings.

51
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,676
He's the kind
who kills people for pleasure.

52
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,223
I think he's the Jack.

53
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,471
There are only five people left,
and I've lost my partner.

54
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:18,229
A minute ago,
that Matsushita guy told me my suit.

55
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:23,568
But I don't think he trusts me,
so I think he probably lied.

56
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,365
You know, you look really honest.

57
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,617
I don't think you'd lie.

58
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,664
Could you please tell me what my suit is?

59
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,502
Of course, I'll tell you
what your suit is.

60
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,129
And I'll be truthful.

61
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,597
You sure seem to be
infatuated with that Yaba guy.

62
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,600
That's how a con man works, you know.

63
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,783
I won't beat around the bush.

64
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,536
Are you the Jack of Hearts?

65
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,373
The only way

66
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,293
I can answer that question

67
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,588
is to say it could be either you or me.

68
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,096
Just as I thought,
I doubt you and I can get along.

69
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,558
<i>Your suit...</i>

70
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,894
is heart.

71
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,855
Mine...

72
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,566
is club, right?

73
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,454
{\an8}These ones are better.

74
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,587
<i>Five people left.</i>

75
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,589
<i>There are two pairs.</i>

76
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,758
<i>The Jack will surely move this round.</i>

77
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,812
Well...

78
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,398
This must be the final round.

79
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,584
Heart.

80
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,925
Thank you.

81
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,189
Diamond.

82
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,868
Spade.

83
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,215
Okay, tell me mine now.

84
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,429
Spade.

85
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,143
<i>It is time to make your guess.</i>

86
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,856
<i>Everyone, please enter a prison cell.
One person per cell, please.</i>

87
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,951
ROUND 13

88
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,790
The suit Matsushita told me
is most certainly a lie.

89
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,211
And Kotoko ignored my question.

90
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,797
This means

91
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,342
I'm either diamond or spade.

92
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,306
Ultimately, I'll have to go

93
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,809
with intuition.

94
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,246
<i>Please make your guess.</i>

95
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,504
I won.

96
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:40,402
You're the Jack of Hearts,
just as I thought.

97
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,740
How...

98
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,577
I saw when you and the murderer,
Banda, paired up.

99
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,872
Let's be friends.

100
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,502
<i>Even if</i>

101
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,588
you were impressed by what Banda said,

102
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,677
there's no way anyone could be
accepting of a stranger so quickly.

103
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,392
There aren't many people
who'd approach someone like me.

104
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,522
And if you tried to kill me,

105
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,857
then you're either scheming,

106
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,528
you're just a plain idiot,
a psychopath, or a sociopath.

107
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,697
Why you...

108
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,158
To find that out, I decided to play along.

109
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,538
You thought that you could control me.

110
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:38,335
Also, you were confident
that you were superior to everyone else.

111
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:45,968
And the more important your position is,
the more your confidence manifests itself.

112
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,221
Like the Jack of Hearts.

113
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,181
Sorry, but it's not me.

114
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,100
Banda is the Jack.

115
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,768
It's such a shame,

116
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,524
but it's not him.

117
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,412
You were in cahoots with Kotoko.

118
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,874
I told Kotoko her real suit.

119
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,752
But still, she died.

120
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,756
This means

121
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,510
somebody else was controlling Kotoko.

122
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,430
Then...

123
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,642
Then that guy must be him.

124
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,477
When I was in the cafeteria,

125
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,523
each of you would always come
and get snacks around the same time.

126
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,195
<i>What do you think?</i>

127
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,280
<i>Who should go first?</i>

128
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,331
<i>Every time,</i>

129
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,376
<i>you'd get the same type of snacks.</i>

130
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,887
<i>You and Kotoko used
the cafeteria to communicate.</i>

131
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:13,847
Spade...

132
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,687
Both of you pretended
that you were being controlled.

133
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,447
<i>Those snacks come in four flavors.</i>

134
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,369
<i>You used the snacks that you got...</i>

135
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,999
<i>to confirm with each other
whether your suit was right or not.</i>

136
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,933
<i>Then...</i>

137
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,270
<i>you told Kotoko
to lie to me about my suit.</i>

138
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,439
Diamond.

139
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,028
<i>I honestly did trust that woman.</i>

140
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,573
Except at the end.

141
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,870
When did you three start working together?

142
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,539
In the opening announcement for this game,

143
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,126
they said that it's a test
of how much you can trust others.

144
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,337
We simply followed that advice.

145
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,468
The surest way to ensure trust

146
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,555
isn't through persuasion, manipulation,
or even domination,

147
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,850
nor is it through brainwashing, hypnotism,

148
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,603
deception, or fear.

149
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,024
It's equality.

150
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,035
Just as I thought,
I doubt you and I can get along.

151
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,620
By the way,

152
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:06,668
why are you participating
in the games in this land?

153
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,091
Until now,

154
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,594
I've never been in a land
as beautiful as this one.

155
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,933
Because I believe

156
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:26,230
this is the only world
that is worthy of my control.

157
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,653
I think you and I might be very similar.

158
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,118
I thought the same thing.

159
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,122
Trust is important in this game.

160
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,297
I think I've finally found
an equal partner worthy of my trust.

161
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,763
Still...

162
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,892
It's still possible that
one of you is the Jack of Hearts!

163
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,272
Yeah, maybe I did try to deceive you guys,

164
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,693
but you can't declare
I'm the Jack of Hearts just based on that!

165
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,945
I wouldn't be so sure.

166
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:15,863
What?

167
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,908
If those two were certain

168
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,703
that you were the Jack of Hearts,

169
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,917
then why didn't Banda lie to you
during the last round and try to kill you?

170
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,633
They must have made a deal

171
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,180
and are going to try
to get some info out of you.

172
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,280
<i>Round 14 will now start.</i>

173
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,744
What are you going to do to me?

174
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:10,042
One doesn't often get the chance to have
a nice long conversation with a citizen.

175
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,878
You'll tell us everything
you know about this land.

176
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,427
It's unfortunate that I can't kill you.

177
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,600
But I can still have fun with you.

178
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,449
TEIO PRISON

179
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,322
We couldn't get that much out of him.

180
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,785
I guess he couldn't handle it
and guessed wrong on purpose.

181
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,664
And we even told him
the truth about his suit.

182
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,418
He gave up sooner than I expected.

183
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,351
<i>I am Kaito Kameyama.</i>

184
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,854
<i>-It was...
-I'm going outside Tokyo.</i>

185
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,606
<i>It's fun here.</i>

186
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,775
<i>Since there are no laws,</i>

187
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,403
<i>you can steal or kill
without being punished.</i>

188
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,697
<i>When I'm playing a game,</i>

189
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,200
<i>it's like nothing matters at all!</i>

190
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,953
<i>It feels pretty damn good.</i>

191
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,707
<i>I fucking hate this place.</i>

192
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,460
<i>That's why I smoke weed...</i>

193
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,713
<i>and cower.</i>

194
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,010
<i>What is this world?</i>

195
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,096
<i>What are these games?</i>

196
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,891
<i>Who the heck is organizing them?</i>

197
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,186
<i>Are you alright?</i>

198
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,690
<i>Don't just film us! Give me a hand!</i>

199
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,568
<i>You must be insane!</i>

200
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,539
<i>Here, life is meaningless.</i>

201
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,170
<i>Human life has no value.</i>

202
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,092
<i>Is that what this world
is trying to teach us?</i>

203
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,076
<i>Arisu...</i>

204
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,536
Do it!

205
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,745
You couldn't return, right?

206
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,288
<i>We'll all die!</i>

207
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,058
There.

208
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,768
Thank you.

209
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,942
When...

210
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,823
I heard Kyuma's last words,

211
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,285
I realized something.

212
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,165
They had originally been players.

213
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,959
But now,

214
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,504
they'd become citizens
and were making games here.

215
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,177
It means...

216
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,683
even if we clear all these games,

217
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,438
we might not be able to go back.

218
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,318
The world

219
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,031
that we came from may not exist anymore.

220
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,577
Did I...

221
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,706
kill Tatta...

222
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,334
just for that?

223
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,600
That can't be true.

224
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,979
I'm sure we can go back.

225
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,649
I'm going for it.

226
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,485
I'll keep playing the games.

227
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,156
For Tatta's sake too.

228
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,046
Are you really leaving?

229
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:53,385
I'm still worried about Ann and Chishiya.
I'm going to look for them.

230
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,391
We'll need more teammates if
we're going to defeat the King of Spades.

231
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:04,688
If we can clear even one game,
we'll be closer to our goal.

232
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,067
Don't you worry.

233
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,403
I swear, we'll meet again someday.

234
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,825
Usagi, you need to take a little break.

235
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,620
Arisu!

236
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,539
You take care of Usagi.

237
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,586
Okay, take care of yourselves.

238
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,015
<i>Oh, well.</i>

239
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,976
<i>Wish I could go to some unknown place.</i>

240
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,232
It would be bad if zombies
were to appear in Shibuya, huh?

241
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,860
If they're all bitten here,
they will all turn into zombies!

242
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,363
Stop it with the zombie talk,
and think about which shop to go to.

243
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,449
But if zombies were to appear,
I guess only Karube would survive.

244
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,201
You'd knock those zombies out
with one punch.

245
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,411
No, it wouldn't be me.

246
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,954
You'd be the one to survive, Arisu.

247
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,956
Me? Why?

248
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,959
I'm sure you're the one who will survive.

249
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,223
<i>What's your deal?</i>

250
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,726
You think your life's over now?

251
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,978
What?

252
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,565
Quit making that face
like it's the end of the world.

253
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,819
I wasn't sure what you wanted to tell us,

254
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,446
but it was pretty stupid.

255
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,618
Is your life so pathetic that missing
some dumb interview will end it?

256
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,579
Who cares about that stupid shit?

257
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,081
Your dad pulled some strings?

258
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,667
Just blow it off
and figure out what to do later.

259
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:32,669
Arisu.

260
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,923
In life, even when it seems like
you've hit a dead end,

261
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:40,760
you turn a corner, and there'll be
a narrow road leading you further.

262
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,894
That's not very convincing
coming from a part-time bartender.

263
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,022
Then you say something cool.
You have any good ideas?

264
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,858
Well, let me see...

265
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,484
What? You don't?

266
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,404
-But what you said was cool.
-Oh, fuck off.

267
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,031
My mind went totally blank.

268
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,199
Enough of your shit, man.

269
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,202
It's mugwort.

270
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,899
Say, why don't we go hunting?

271
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,070
We're out of food, you know?

272
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,948
If we don't get anything,

273
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,283
it'll be weeds for dinner again.

274
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,212
Here!

275
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,842
{\an8}If you want meat, then give me a hand.

276
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:06,739
Arisu!

277
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,389
Get to it, would you, Arisu?

278
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,519
There's no food for dinner.

279
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,988
Arisu! There! Over there!

280
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,294
Over there!

281
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,764
I see it.

282
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,150
You almost had it!

283
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,319
What's your problem?

284
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,782
Darn it!

285
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,455
Over there!

286
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,665
Oh! Over here!

287
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,458
Usagi, over there!

288
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,339
Oh, darn!

289
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,091
Arisu, over there!

290
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,142
Oh, I can't get it.

291
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,895
It's just no good.

292
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,106
No dinner tonight.

293
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,942
But I'm starving.

294
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,602
Are you okay?

295
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,858
The film...

296
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,528
Film?

297
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,006
It's in here.

298
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,283
He must have been a photographer.

299
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,249
This is 8mm film.

300
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,461
Do you watch it with this?

301
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,713
<i>I am Kaito Kameyama.</i>

302
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,383
<i>In this world
where electronics don't work,</i>

303
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,136
<i>I want to use this 8mm film camera</i>

304
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,097
<i>to make a record of this world
in order to discover</i>

305
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,809
<i>the truth and reality of it.</i>

306
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,440
<i>It's fun here.</i>

307
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,400
<i>Since there are no laws,</i>

308
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,861
<i>you can steal or kill
without being punished.</i>

309
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,113
<i>When I'm playing a game,</i>

310
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,408
<i>it's like nothing matters at all!</i>

311
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,078
<i>It feels pretty damn good.</i>

312
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,498
<i>I fucking hate this place.</i>

313
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,584
<i>That's why I smoke weed</i>

314
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,462
<i>and cower.</i>

315
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,388
<i>It has been 26 days
since everyone disappeared.</i>

316
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,442
<i>What are you doing?</i>

317
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,654
That's Ann.

318
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,831
<i>Excuse me. What's wrong?</i>

319
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,671
<i>The fish are increasing in numbers
and the vegetation is becoming denser.</i>

320
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,299
<i>The farther from the city center,</i>

321
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,010
<i>the more the city is
covered in vegetation.</i>

322
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,679
<i>Isn't it because there are no more humans?</i>

323
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,889
<i>Of course, that's part of it.</i>

324
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,143
<i>But the vegetation is growing
at an incredible pace.</i>

325
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,397
<i>Each person came to this world
at different times,</i>

326
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:41,235
<i>and food rotted quickly,
so time isn't flowing normally.</i>

327
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,365
<i>Where are you going?</i>

328
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,953
<i>I'm going outside of Tokyo.</i>

329
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,290
<i>I want to know just what this world is.</i>

330
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,091
<i>It has been 33 days
since everyone disappeared.</i>

331
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,094
<i>I learned something from a man I met.</i>

332
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,015
<i>A community has been established
on the outskirts of Setagaya.</i>

333
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,600
<i>I'm headed there now.</i>

334
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:32,161
<i>I came to this community
because I heard there's someone here</i>

335
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,662
<i>who remembers something strange.</i>

336
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,457
<i>Can you take me to them?</i>

337
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,209
<i>This way.</i>

338
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,965
<i>What is it they remember?</i>

339
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,969
<i>Do you remember
when you came to this world?</i>

340
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,514
<i>Yeah, a little bit.</i>

341
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:56,352
<i>So, did you see those fireworks then?</i>

342
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,020
<i>Fireworks?</i>

343
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,067
<i>Yes, I did. I saw them. I remember.</i>

344
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,779
<i>I saw them too.</i>

345
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,574
<i>This way. Come on.</i>

346
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,172
<i>This lady's story is super realistic.</i>

347
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,674
<i>Come on.</i>

348
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,801
<i>Here. She's over here.</i>

349
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,348
<i>Tell him that story about those fireworks.</i>

350
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,435
<i>Yes.</i>

351
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,270
<i>Oh...</i>

352
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,564
<i>About the fireworks?</i>

353
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,697
<i>You want to hear about the fireworks too?</i>

354
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,574
<i>Yes.</i>

355
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,954
<i>I guess nobody remembers it.</i>

356
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,373
<i>What?</i>

357
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,044
<i>When I was a child,</i>

358
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,757
<i>I had holes drilled into my skull</i>

359
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,677
<i>when I had an operation done on my brain.</i>

360
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,181
<i>That might be why...</i>

361
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:23,314
<i>But I seem to be the only one
who remembers everything about that day.</i>

362
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:31,405
<i>When the fireworks appeared in the sky...</i>

363
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:39,497
<i>They looked like fireworks in the sky.</i>

364
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,333
<i>But</i>

365
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,878
<i>actually, that wasn't...</i>

366
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,839
<i>fireworks...</i>

367
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,257
<i>He's here again!</i>

368
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,389
<i>The King of Spades is here again!</i>

369
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,841
<i>This film</i>

370
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,555
<i>is the only proof that I lived.</i>

371
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,476
<i>I must leave this film for others.</i>

372
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,302
Something is coming.

373
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,610
This way, Arisu!

374
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,157
Watch out!

375
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,533
Go!

376
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,056
Usagi!

377
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:14,943
Hey!

378
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:28,600
Usagi?

379
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,106
Who's there?

380
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,260
Are you a citizen?

381
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:05,596
What?

382
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,724
I guess you aren't.

383
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,644
Ow...

384
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,314
Then why did you attack me?

385
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,984
If you had kept running,
you would have died.

386
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,822
I told him to leave you
since you'd only be a drag,

387
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:28,160
but he carried you
all the way here anyhow.

388
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:30,913
"He"?

389
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,256
You'd better go thank him, Arisu.

390
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,051
How come you know my name?

391
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,595
He told me.

392
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,602
But be careful.

393
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,563
Since you interfered with our plan,

394
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,065
he's in a bad mood.

395
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,319
Aguni...

396
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,366
Yo, newbie.

397
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:31,737
